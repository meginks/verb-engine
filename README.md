# verb-engine

This will be an attempt to derive and compare the rules for conjugating verbs in Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese using Python.

I have separate repositories for the verb conjugators in these languages: 
- Spanish ([Spanish Verb Conjugator](https://github.com/meginks/spanish-verb-conjugator))
- French ([French Verb Conjugator](https://github.com/meginks/french-verb-conjugator))
- Portuguese([Portuguese Verb Conjugator](https://github.com/meginks/portuguese-verb-conjugator))
- Italian ([Italian Verb Conjugator](https://github.com/meginks/italian-verb-conjugator)) 


My plan for Verb Engine is to combine the rules from the above projects in a way that allows for comparison. This is a self-education project with the goal of internalizing these rules through the medium of code and to increase my fluency in these languages by looking at their similarities and differences grammatically. If it helps anyone else make sense of the verbs in these languages, that's great, but I am not a linguist or an expert, so there may be mistakes. If you find any, please let me know.
